# Performance

Measured findings for tt-sim's renderer, and the procedure that produced them. Read
this before attempting any rendering optimisation -- several obvious-looking ideas are
already known dead ends, with numbers.

## Where the frame goes

Dense forest map ("Sandy Clearing"), 1920x1080, vsync disabled, deterministic camera
pose (Home), RTX 3080. Isolated with the in-game render toggles (F3, then digits 1-9).

| Isolation | frame_ms | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | 14.46 | -- |
| Foliage hidden | 3.46 | -16.3M primitives, -11.00 ms (-76%) |
| Sun shadows off | 8.58 | -5.88 ms (-41%) |
| Grass not casting | 11.93 | -2.53 ms (-17%) |
| Trees not casting | 12.17 | -2.29 ms (-16%) |
| Trivial foliage shader | 12.77 | -1.69 ms (-12%) |
| Terrain not casting | 14.43 | -0.03 ms (free) |

Foliage is 76% of the frame and 16.3M of 19.36M visible-pass primitives. A bare-terrain
map renders in 1.58 ms with 46K primitives.

A `MultiMeshInstance3D` is frustum-culled as a **single AABB**, and foliage is one
MultiMesh per species spanning the whole map. If any part of a species is on screen,
every instance is vertex-processed: visible-pass primitives read an identical 19,361,510
at every camera pose tried, and panning changed nothing. **Total instance count per map
is the cost driver, not density per unit area and not what is in frame.**

## The foliage primitive budget

`utils/foliage_budget.gd` caps total scatter primitives per map at `PRIMITIVE_BUDGET`
(8,000,000) and thins any imported map that exceeds it, proportionally across species,
by seeded shuffle. `ScatterGlbUtils.process_scatter_instances()` applies it;
`level_loader.gd` shows the player one toast when it fires.

The threshold is **provisional** -- derived from one scene on one GPU, roughly half that
map's foliage load. It needs validating on slower hardware. The budget is deliberately
not overridable per level: a budget a map can opt out of does not bound anything.

Only `user://` imported maps are affected. `load_map()`'s `res://` branch never calls
the scatter pipeline, so built-in maps are untouched.

## Known dead ends -- do not revisit without new evidence

- **General triangle budgets.** 420x the geometry cost only 9.2x the frame time. Raw
  triangle count is not the binding constraint; foliage instance count is.
- **Terrain decimation.** Terrain not casting shadows saved 0.03 ms. Terrain is free.
- **Distance-based LOD, billboards, impostors keyed on camera distance.** The camera is
  orthographic, so apparent size does not shrink with depth -- degrading distant foliage
  is *more* visible here than in a perspective game. The orthographic-correct
  reformulation is zoom-based, driven by `camera.size`. Not yet attempted.
- **Automatic mesh LOD.** Godot picks one LOD per MultiMesh node, not per instance, and
  orthographic screen coverage does not vary with distance.
- **Occlusion culling.** A `MultiMeshInstance3D` cannot be an occludee in the bake
  workflow, and all foliage here is MultiMesh.
- **PCF shadow filter tuning.** Measured at 0.6 ms. Not worth touching.
- **Shortening `directional_shadow_max_distance`.** Swept 100/50/30: shadow-pass
  primitives were byte-identical at 15,586,440 for all three, because every caster is
  already inside 30 units. Recorded in `level_environment_manager.gd`.
- **`alpha_to_coverage` for the shadow pass.** Does not help (godotengine/godot#84242).
- **`visibility_range` to skip distant foliage.** Hidden instances stop casting
  directional shadows entirely (godotengine/godot#98993), which changes lighting.

Grass no longer casts shadows (measured -16% of frame time): Godot runs the shadow
pass's `fragment()` with the same code as the colour pass (godot-proposals#4443), and
the foliage shader's alpha-cutout `discard` disables early-Z for that draw, so dense
overlapping grass pays full fragment cost per covered sample. A base-dark/tip-light
albedo gradient in `WindFoliage.apply_material` replaces the contact darkening the real
shadow used to provide.

## How to measure without fooling yourself

Three separate instrument failures produced three wrong conclusions during this work.
All three are avoidable:

1. **Pin the viewport.** `project.godot` sets `window/stretch/aspect="expand"`, so a
   window taller than 16:9 inflates the SubViewport (height = 1920 / window_aspect). A
   0.94-aspect window gave 1920x2043 = 3.92 MP and turned a healthy 58.8 FPS into 3.7.
   Identical primitives and draw calls at both sizes -- the cliff is pure fill cost.
   Always record `viewport_width`/`viewport_height` (CSV columns 20/21) alongside any
   FPS number, and never compare across different viewports.
2. **Disable vsync.** It is on by default, so healthy runs sit at ~17 ms with unknown
   headroom. A comparison at the cap cannot detect a regression, and neither can one at
   a fill-bound floor.
3. **Compare only within a single run.** GPU clock throttling drifts absolute frame
   times badly across a session: the same scene and pose read 1.48x slower after a few
   hours, cleanly multiplicative across three configurations. A cross-run A/B shows
   several ms of pure drift. An unexplained uniform offset across every configuration is
   drift, not a regression -- check that before blaming the change.

Working procedure. Write an untracked `override.cfg` in the project root (Godot reads it
at runtime and it survives `git checkout`, so both branches measure identically):

```
[display]

window/size/viewport_width=1920
window/size/viewport_height=1080
window/stretch/mode="canvas_items"
window/stretch/aspect="keep"
```

`aspect="keep"` pins the SubViewport regardless of window shape. Disabling vsync must
happen in `user://settings.cfg`, not here: `scenes/root.gd` applies saved graphics
settings at boot and overrides `override.cfg`. Then per run: load the level, press
**Home** for a deterministic camera pose, press **F3** (perf logging only starts when
the overlay is open), wait ~30 s, and read `user://perf_logs/` filtering `elapsed_s > 5`.
Confirm `primitives` and `draw_calls` match between samples before comparing them; if
they differ, the camera differed and the pair is invalid.

Prefer the F3 digit toggles to A/B *inside* one run, then group the CSV by the
`toggle_*` columns -- that is immune to drift. When a change cannot be toggled at
runtime (a const, a project setting, another branch), measure a stable reference
configuration in every run ("foliage hidden" works well) and compare ratios rather than
absolute numbers.

**Delete `override.cfg` and restore `user://settings.cfg` afterwards.** Stop the game as
soon as a measurement finishes -- an idle instance throttles the next run.

Caveats that apply to every number here: these come from a debug build driven through
the validator bridge, not an exported release build, and background `godot --headless`
test runs contend for CPU. Quiesce other work before measuring.
